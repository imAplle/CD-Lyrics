    <p>[Verse 1]<br>
    Did you stand there all alone?<br>
    Oh, I cannot explain what's going down<br>
    I can see you standing next to me<br>
    In and out somewhere else right now<br>
    You sigh, look away<br>
    I can see it clear as day<br>
    Close your eyes, so afraid<br>
    Hide behind that babyface<br>
    <br>
    [Pre-Chorus]<br>
    Do-do-do, do-do-do<br>
    <br>
    [Chorus]<br>
    You can drive all night<br>
    Looking for the answers in the pouring rain<br>
    You wanna find peace of mind<br>
    Looking for the answer</a><br>
    <br>
    [Verse 2]<br>
    Funny how it seems like yesterday<br>
    As I recall, you were looking out of place<br>
    Gathered up your things and slipped away<br>
    No time at all, I followed you into the hall<br>
    Cigarette daydream<br>
    You were only seventeen<br>
    Soft speak with a mean streak<br>
    Nearly brought me to my knees<br>
    <br>
    [Pre-Chorus]<br>
    Do-do-do, do-do-do<br>
    <br>
    [Chorus]<br>
    You can drive all night<br>
    Looking for the answers in the pouring rain<br>
    You wanna find peace of mind<br>
    Looking for the answer<br>
    If we can find a reason, a reason to change<br>
    Looking for the answer<br>
    If you can find a reason, a reason to stay<br>
    Standing in the pouring rain</a><br>
    <br>
    [Bridge]<br>
    Do-do, do-do-do<br>
    Do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
    Do-do, do-do-do<br>
    Do-do, do-do-do-do<br>
    <br>
    [Chorus]<br>
    You can drive all night<br>
    Looking for the answers in the pouring rain<br>
    You wanna find peace of mind<br>
    Looking for the answer<br>
    If we can find a reason, a reason to change<br>
    Looking for the answer<br>
    If you can find a reason, a reason to stay<br>
    Standing in the pouring rain</p>
